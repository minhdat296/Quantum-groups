    \subsection{K-matrices of twisted rational Yangians}
    \todo[inline]{It seems that the existence of and explicit formulae for universal K-matrices of twisted Yangians are not yet known. Therefore, one possible strategy is to take $q \to 1$ in the trigonometric universal K-matrices, and then check on representations to see if this yields intertwiners for representations of twisted Yangians.}
