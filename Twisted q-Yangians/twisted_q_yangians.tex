    \subsection{Trigonometric twisted Yangians vs. QSPs by Drinfeld-Jimbo generators}
        For a moment, let $\g$ be the Kac-Moody algebra associated to a symmetrisable and indecomposable Cartan matrix (cf. \cite[Chapter 1]{kac_infinite_dimensional_lie_algebras}). Recall that given a vector space $V$ and two vector subspaces $V_1, V_2 \subset V$ thereof, those two subspaces are \textbf{commensurable} if $\codim(V_1 \cap V_2, V_1 + V_2) < +\infty$. We say that a Lie algebra automorphism:
            $$\vartheta \in \Aut_{\Lie\Alg}(\g)$$
        is of the \textbf{first kind} (respectively, of the \textbf{second kind}) if $\vartheta(\b^+)$ is commensurable with $\b^+$ (respectively, with $\b^-$) inside $\g$. \textit{A priori}, if $\vartheta$ is of the second kind, then up to conjugation of $\vartheta$ by some inner automorphism of $\g$, we have that:
            $$\vartheta(\h) = \h$$
        and moreover, any $\vartheta$-stable root space is in fact fixed by $\vartheta$. When $\vartheta$ itself possesses these properties, we shall write:
            $$\vartheta \in \Aut_{\Lie\Alg}(\g, \h)$$
        or merely $\vartheta \in \Aut(\g, \h)$. We note that this is a natural notion, seeing that the Chevalley involution, given by $\vartheta(e_i^{\pm}) := -e_i^{\mp}$ and $\vartheta(h_i) := -h_i$, is an example of an automorphism of the second kind. 
        \begin{definition}[Pseudo-involutions] \label{def: pseudo_involutions}
            A \textbf{pseudo-involution} of the symmetrisable Kac-Moody algbera $\g$ is an automorphism:
                $$\vartheta \in \Aut_{\Lie\Alg}(\g, \h)$$
            such that its restriction $\vartheta|_{\h} \in \Aut_{\Lie\Alg}(\h)$ down onto any Cartan subalgebra $\h \subset \g$ is involutive. 
        \end{definition}

    \subsection{Degenerating to rational twisted Yangians; rational K-matrices}
    \todo[inline]{It seems that the existence of and explicit formulae for universal K-matrices of twisted Yangians are not yet known. Therefore, one possible strategy is to take $q \to 1$ in the trigonometric universal K-matrices, and then check on representations to see if this yields intertwiners for representations of twisted Yangians.}
