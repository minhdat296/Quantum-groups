In the event that a spin chain exists within a so-called boundary condition, i.e. an external physical presence with which the particles in the spin chain may also interact (e.g. an external magnetic field), then the algebra of symmetries must also be set up in a way that takes into account particle-boundary interactions. Again, we assume that momentum is conserved while the internal quantum states are modified during interactions, so the device controlling these interactions with the boundary is first and foremost an element:
    $$\calK(u) \in \End(\bbC^N)(\!(u^{-1})\!)$$
